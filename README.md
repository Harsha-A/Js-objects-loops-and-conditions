Object related methods

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a language-agnostic format for storing and transferring data. It's based on JavaScript objects. JSON is used primarily to transmit data between a server and web application. 
A JavaScript object is a variable that stores data in key-value pairs. You can create an object using object literal syntax.

(JSON) JSON.parse ---> JS Obj
(JS Obj) JSON.stringify ---> JSON

In JavaScript, objects are a fundamental data structure and can have various methods and properties. Here are some commonly used methods that you can perform on objects, along with examples:

1. **Object.keys(obj)**: Returns an array of an object's own property names.

   ```javascript
   const person = { name: 'John', age: 30, job: 'Engineer' };
   const keys = Object.keys(person);
   console.log(keys); // ["name", "age", "job"]
   ```

2. **Object.values(obj)**: Returns an array of an object's own property values.

   ```javascript
   const person = { name: 'John', age: 30, job: 'Engineer' };
   const values = Object.values(person);
   console.log(values); // ["John", 30, "Engineer"]
   ```

3. **Object.entries(obj)**: Returns an array of an object's own property key-value pairs as arrays.

   ```javascript
   const person = { name: 'John', age: 30, job: 'Engineer' };
   const entries = Object.entries(person);
   console.log(entries); // [["name", "John"], ["age", 30], ["job", "Engineer"]]
   ```

4. **Object.assign(target, source1, source2, ...)**: Copies the values of all enumerable properties from one or more source objects to a target object and returns the target object.

   ```javascript
   const target = { a: 1, b: 2 };
   const source = { b: 3, c: 4 };
   const result = Object.assign(target, source);
   console.log(result); // { a: 1, b: 3, c: 4 }
   ```

5. **Object.freeze(obj)**: Freezes an object, making it immutable (properties cannot be added, changed, or removed).

   ```javascript
   const person = Object.freeze({ name: 'John', age: 30 });
   person.name = 'Jane'; // This will not change the name property.
   ```

6. **Object.seal(obj)**: Seals an object, making its properties non-configurable, but still modifiable.

   ```javascript
   const person = Object.seal({ name: 'John', age: 30 });
   delete person.name; // This will not work (non-configurable), but you can still change the age.
   ```

7. **Object.keys(obj).length**: Get the number of own properties in an object.

   ```javascript
   const person = { name: 'John', age: 30, job: 'Engineer' };
   const numProperties = Object.keys(person).length;
   console.log(numProperties); // 3
   ```

8. **Object.hasOwnProperty(key)**: Checks if an object has a specific property.

   ```javascript
   const person = { name: 'John', age: 30, job: 'Engineer' };
   const hasName = person.hasOwnProperty('name');
   console.log(hasName); // true
   ```

These are some of the commonly used methods and properties for working with objects in JavaScript. Objects in JavaScript are highly versatile and can be manipulated in various ways to manage and retrieve data.

===================
# For loops

There are several types of loops available in most programming languages, including `for`, `while`, and `do...while` loops. Each type of loop has its own use cases and syntax. Here, I'll explain these loops and provide examples in JavaScript:

1. **`for` Loop:**

   The `for` loop is commonly used when you know the number of iterations in advance.

   ```javascript
   for (initialization; condition; update) {
       // code to be executed
   }
   ```

   Example:
   ```javascript
   for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
       console.log(`Iteration ${i}`);
   }
   ```

2. **`while` Loop:**

   The `while` loop continues execution as long as a specified condition is true.

   ```javascript
   while (condition) {
       // code to be executed
   }
   ```

   Example:
   ```javascript
   let i = 0;
   while (i < 5) {
       console.log(`Iteration ${i}`);
       i++;
   }
   ```

3. **`do...while` Loop:**

   The `do...while` loop is similar to the `while` loop, but it always executes the code block at least once, and then checks the condition.

   ```javascript
   do {
       // code to be executed
   } while (condition);
   ```

   Example:
   ```javascript
   let i = 0;
   do {
       console.log(`Iteration ${i}`);
       i++;
   } while (i < 5);
   ```

4. **`for...in` Loop (for iterating over object properties):**

   The `for...in` loop is used to loop through the properties of an object.

   ```javascript
   for (let variable in object) {
       // code to be executed
   }
   ```

   Example:
   ```javascript
   const person = { name: 'Alice', age: 30 };
   for (let key in person) {
       console.log(`${key}: ${person[key]}`);
   }
   ```

5. **`for...of` Loop (for iterating over iterable objects like arrays):**

   The `for...of` loop is used for iterating over iterable objects.

   ```javascript
   for (let variable of iterable) {
       // code to be executed
   }
   ```

   Example:
   ```javascript
   const colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue'];
   for (let color of colors) {
       console.log(color);
   }
   ```

```javascript
const person = { name: 'John Doe', age: 30, address: '123 Main Street' };

const entries = Object.entries(person);

for (const [key, value] of entries) {
  console.log(`${key}: ${value}`);
}
```

This will log the key-value pairs of the `person` object using a template literal. The output will look like:

```
name: John Doe
age: 30
address: 123 Main Street
```

These are some of the common types of loops in JavaScript. The choice of loop depends on the specific requirements of your program and the data you are working with.


===============

# forEach & map

Certainly, here are examples of the `forEach` and `map` methods in JavaScript, which are commonly used for iterating over arrays:

**`forEach` Method:**

The `forEach` method is used for executing a provided function once for each element in an array, in order.

Example:

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

numbers.forEach(function(number) {
    console.log(number * 2);
});
```

In this example, the provided function is executed for each element in the `numbers` array, doubling each number and logging the result.

**`map` Method:**

The `map` method creates a new array by applying a function to each element of an existing array.

Example:

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const doubledNumbers = numbers.map(function(number) {
    return number * 2;
});

console.log(doubledNumbers);
```

In this example, the `map` method creates a new array `doubledNumbers` by doubling each element from the `numbers` array.

Key differences:

- `forEach` is used for iterating over an array, but it doesn't create a new array. It is typically used for performing actions on the array elements without changing the array itself.

- `map` is used to create a new array by applying a function to each element of an existing array. It returns a modified version of the original array.

Both methods are powerful and widely used in JavaScript for array manipulation, but they serve different purposes. Use `forEach` when you need to iterate over elements and perform actions, and use `map` when you want to create a new array based on the original array.

# ES6 Features 

Certainly! Here are some key ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) features explained with examples for an interview:

1. **Arrow Functions:**
   Arrow functions provide a more concise syntax for writing functions.

   ```javascript
   // ES5
   function add(a, b) {
       return a + b;
   }

   // ES6
   const add = (a, b) => a + b;
   ```

2. **Template Literals:**
   Template literals allow embedding expressions inside strings.

   ```javascript
   // ES5
   var name = "John";
   var greeting = "Hello, " + name + "!";

   // ES6
   let name = "John";
   let greeting = `Hello, ${name}!`;
   ```

3. **Destructuring Assignment:**
   Destructuring allows you to extract values from arrays and objects easily.

   ```javascript
   // ES6
   const [x, y] = [1, 2];
   const { firstName, lastName } = { firstName: "John", lastName: "Doe" };
   ```

4. **Spread and Rest Operators:**
   The spread operator spreads elements of an array or properties of an object, and the rest operator collects them.

   ```javascript
   // Spread operator
   const arr1 = [1, 2];
   const arr2 = [...arr1, 3, 4];

   // Rest operator
   function sum(...numbers) {
       return numbers.reduce((total, num) => total + num, 0);
   }
   ```

5. **Let and Const:**
   `let` and `const` provide block-scoped variable declarations.

   ```javascript
   // ES5
   var a = 5;

   // ES6
   let b = 5;
   const c = 10;
   ```

6. **Classes:**
   ES6 introduces class syntax for defining classes and constructor functions.

   ```javascript
   class Person {
       constructor(name) {
           this.name = name;
       }

       greet() {
           return `Hello, my name is ${this.name}.`;
       }
   }
   ```

7. **Promises:**
   Promises provide a better way to work with asynchronous operations.

   ```javascript
   function fetchData() {
       return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
           // Asynchronous operation
           if (/* success */) {
               resolve(data);
           } else {
               reject(error);
           }
       });
   }
   ```

8. **Default Parameters:**
   You can set default values for function parameters.

   ```javascript
   function greet(name = "World") {
       return `Hello, ${name}!`;
   }
   ```

9. **Modules:**
   ES6 introduces a module system to encapsulate and organize code.

   ```javascript
   // Export
   export function add(a, b) {
       return a + b;
   }

   // Import
   import { add } from "./math";
   ```

10. **Map and Set:**
    Map and Set data structures provide efficient ways to store and manipulate data.

    ```javascript
    const myMap = new Map();
    myMap.set("key", "value");

    const mySet = new Set();
    mySet.add(1);
    mySet.add(2);
    ```

These are some of the key ES6 features, which have become standard in modern JavaScript development. Familiarity with these features can be a valuable asset during interviews.

# Deep Clone & Shallow Clone

In JavaScript, when you clone an object, you can perform either a deep clone or a shallow clone, depending on how you want to duplicate the object's structure and values. Here's a detailed explanation of both concepts:

**Shallow Clone:**
A shallow clone creates a new object that is a copy of the original object, but it does not create copies of nested objects or their properties. Instead, it copies references to nested objects. In other words, the top-level object is duplicated, but the nested objects are shared between the original and the clone.

For example:
```javascript
const originalObject = { a: 1, b: { c: 2 } };
const shallowClone = { ...originalObject };

shallowClone.b.c = 3;

console.log(originalObject.b.c); // 3 (changes the original)
```

In the above code, `shallowClone` is a new object, but both the `originalObject.b` and `shallowClone.b` reference the same nested object.

**Deep Clone:**
A deep clone, on the other hand, creates a completely new object with copies of all nested objects and their properties. It results in a completely independent copy of the original object, including all levels of nesting.

To perform a deep clone, you can use various techniques, such as recursion or specialized libraries like Lodash's `_.cloneDeep()` or the `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj))` approach. Here's an example using the `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj))` method:

```javascript
const originalObject = { a: 1, b: { c: 2 } };
const deepClone = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(originalObject));

deepClone.b.c = 3;

console.log(originalObject.b.c); // 2 (original is not affected)
```

In this case, `deepClone` is a new object, and changes to the nested object do not affect the original.

Keep in mind that deep cloning can be computationally expensive, especially for complex objects with many levels of nesting or large data structures. Shallow cloning is more efficient but may not provide the isolation needed if you want to make independent modifications to objects and their nested structures. Your choice between deep and shallow cloning should depend on your specific use case and performance considerations.



============
# Js array methods

JavaScript arrays have a variety of methods for manipulating and working with their elements. Here are some common methods available for arrays with examples:

1. **`push()`** - Adds one or more elements to the end of an array and returns the new length.
   ```javascript
   const fruits = ['apple', 'banana'];
   const newLength = fruits.push('orange');
   // fruits is now ['apple', 'banana', 'orange']
   ```

2. **`pop()`** - Removes the last element from an array and returns that element.
   ```javascript
   const fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange'];
   const lastFruit = fruits.pop();
   // lastFruit is 'orange', fruits is now ['apple', 'banana']
   ```

3. **`shift()`** - Removes the first element from an array and returns that element.
   ```javascript
   const fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange'];
   const firstFruit = fruits.shift();
   // firstFruit is 'apple', fruits is now ['banana', 'orange']
   ```

4. **`unshift()`** - Adds one or more elements to the beginning of an array and returns the new length.
   ```javascript
   const fruits = ['banana', 'orange'];
   const newLength = fruits.unshift('apple');
   // fruits is now ['apple', 'banana', 'orange']
   ```

5. **`concat()`** - Combines two or more arrays and returns a new array.
   ```javascript
   const arr1 = [1, 2];
   const arr2 = [3, 4];
   const combined = arr1.concat(arr2);
   // combined is [1, 2, 3, 4]
   ```

6. **`join()`** - Joins all elements of an array into a string.
   ```javascript
   const fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange'];
   const fruitString = fruits.join(', ');
   // fruitString is 'apple, banana, orange'
   ```

7. **`slice()`** - Extracts a section of an array and returns a new array.
   ```javascript
   const fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange', 'grape'];
   const slicedFruits = fruits.slice(1, 3);
   // slicedFruits is ['banana', 'orange']
   ```

8. **`splice()`** - Changes the contents of an array by removing, replacing, or adding elements.
   ```javascript
   const fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange'];
   const removedFruits = fruits.splice(1, 1, 'grape', 'kiwi');
   // removedFruits is ['banana'], fruits is now ['apple', 'grape', 'kiwi', 'orange']
   ```

9. **`forEach()`** - Executes a provided function once for each array element.
   ```javascript
   const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
   numbers.forEach(function (num) {
       console.log(num * 2);
   });
   // Outputs: 2, 4, 6
   ```

10. **`map()`** - Creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on each element.
    ```javascript
    const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
    const doubled = numbers.map(function (num) {
        return num * 2;
    });
    // doubled is [2, 4, 6]
    ```

These are just a few examples of array methods in JavaScript. Arrays have a rich set of methods for searching, filtering, and manipulating data, making them versatile and powerful data structures.

=======
# Higher Order Functions

Higher-order functions are functions that can take other functions as arguments, return functions, or both. They are a powerful concept in functional programming. Here are some examples of higher-order functions in JavaScript:

1. **`map()`** - A function that takes another function and applies it to each element of an array, returning a new array with the results.
   ```javascript
   const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
   const doubled = numbers.map(function (num) {
       return num * 2;
   });
   // doubled is [2, 4, 6]
   ```

2. **`filter()`** - A function that takes a predicate function and returns a new array containing all elements for which the predicate returns `true`.
   ```javascript
   const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
   const evenNumbers = numbers.filter(function (num) {
       return num % 2 === 0;
   });
   // evenNumbers is [2, 4]
   ```

3. **`reduce()`** - A function that takes a combining function and applies it to the elements of an array, accumulating a single result.
   ```javascript
   const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
   const sum = numbers.reduce(function (acc, num) {
       return acc + num;
   }, 0);
   // sum is 15
   ```

4. **`sort()`** - A function that takes a comparison function to sort elements in an array based on a specific criterion.
   ```javascript
   const words = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'];
   const sortedWords = words.sort(function (a, b) {
       return a.localeCompare(b);
   });
   // sortedWords is ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
   ```

5. **`forEach()`** - A function that iterates over an array and applies a given function to each element.
   ```javascript
   const colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue'];
   colors.forEach(function (color) {
       console.log(`Color: ${color}`);
   });
   // Outputs: Color: red, Color: green, Color: blue
   ```

6. **`find()`** - A function that takes a testing function and returns the first element in an array that satisfies the test.
   ```javascript
   const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
   const firstEven = numbers.find(function (num) {
       return num % 2 === 0;
   });
   // firstEven is 2
   ```

7. **`every()`** - A function that takes a testing function and returns `true` if all elements in an array pass the test.
   ```javascript
   const numbers = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10];
   const allEven = numbers.every(function (num) {
       return num % 2 === 0;
   });
   // allEven is true
   ```

8. **`some()`** - A function that takes a testing function and returns `true` if at least one element in an array passes the test.
   ```javascript
   const numbers = [1, 3, 5, 6, 7];
   const hasEven = numbers.some(function (num) {
       return num % 2 === 0;
   });
   // hasEven is true
   ```

These are just a few examples of higher-order functions in JavaScript. They promote code reusability and allow for more expressive and declarative code when working with arrays and data.

# Promise & its methods

Node.js is a popular runtime environment for executing JavaScript on the server-side. Promises are a fundamental part of Node.js and JavaScript for handling asynchronous operations. Promises help make asynchronous code more readable and maintainable. In this response, I'll provide you with an overview of Promise methods in Node.js along with detailed examples for each of them.

1. **Promise constructor**: Promises are typically created using the `Promise` constructor.

```javascript
const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  // Asynchronous operation, e.g., fetching data from a database or making an API call
  setTimeout(() => {
    if (/* operation was successful */) {
      resolve("Data retrieved successfully");
    } else {
      reject("Error: Could not retrieve data");
    }
  }, 1000);
});

myPromise
  .then(result => {
    console.log(result);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error(error);
  });
```

2. **Promise.all**: This method is used to wait for all the promises in an iterable to resolve.

```javascript
const promise1 = Promise.resolve(1);
const promise2 = Promise.resolve(2);

Promise.all([promise1, promise2])
  .then(values => {
    console.log(values); // [1, 2]
  });
```

3. **Promise.race**: This method returns a new promise as soon as one of the input promises settles (either resolves or rejects).

```javascript
const promise1 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(resolve, 100, "First");
});
const promise2 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(resolve, 200, "Second");
});

Promise.race([promise1, promise2])
  .then(value => {
    console.log(value); // "First" because it settled first
  });
```

4. **Promise.resolve and Promise.reject**: These are shortcut methods for creating resolved and rejected promises, respectively.

```javascript
const resolvedPromise = Promise.resolve("Resolved");
const rejectedPromise = Promise.reject("Rejected");

resolvedPromise.then(result => {
  console.log(result); // "Resolved"
}).catch(error => {
  console.error(error); // Won't be executed
});

rejectedPromise.then(result => {
  console.log(result); // Won't be executed
}).catch(error => {
  console.error(error); // "Rejected"
});
```

5. **Chaining Promises**: You can chain promises to perform a series of asynchronous operations.

```javascript
function asyncTask1() {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(() => resolve(1), 1000);
  });
}

function asyncTask2(data) {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(() => resolve(data + 2), 1000);
  });
}

asyncTask1()
  .then(result => asyncTask2(result))
  .then(finalResult => {
    console.log(finalResult); // 3
  });
```

6. **Async/Await**: The `async` and `await` keywords simplify working with promises, making asynchronous code look more like synchronous code.

```javascript
async function fetchData() {
  try {
    const result1 = await asyncTask1();
    const result2 = await asyncTask2(result1);
    console.log(result2);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
}

fetchData();
```

These are some of the fundamental Promise methods and techniques in Node.js. They provide a powerful way to work with asynchronous operations, making your code more readable and maintainable.



==========
# let var and const

In the code you provided:

```javascript
for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    setTimeout(function() {
        console.log(i);
    }, 1000);
}
```

The `setTimeout` function is scheduled to run after a 1-second delay. However, due to the behavior of closures and the use of the `var` keyword, all the `console.log(i)` statements will log the final value of `i` (which will be 10) when the `setTimeout` callbacks execute.

Here's what the output will look like:

```javascript
// Output after approximately 1 second:
// 10
// 10
// 10
// 10
// 10
// 10
// 10
// 10
// 10
// 10
```

The reason for this behavior is that `var` has function-level scope, not block-level scope. So, the `i` variable declared in the `for` loop is shared by all the `setTimeout` callbacks, and when the callbacks execute, they all reference the same `i`, which has been incremented to 10 by the time the `setTimeout` callbacks run.

To fix this issue and get the expected behavior, you should use the `let` keyword to create block-scoped variables. Here's the corrected code:

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    setTimeout(function() {
        console.log(i);
    }, 1000);
}
```

With `let`, each `setTimeout` callback will capture its own unique `i` value, and you will get the following output:

```javascript
// Output after approximately 1 second:
// 0
// 1
// 2
// 3
// 4
// 5
// 6
// 7
// 8
// 9
```

Now, each callback logs the correct value of `i` due to the block scope created by the `let` keyword.

Certainly, let's explore a few examples with different scenarios and outputs to illustrate the behavior of `var` and `let` in JavaScript.

**Example 1: Using `var` in a loop with asynchronous code:**

```javascript
for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    setTimeout(function() {
        console.log("Using var: " + i);
    }, 1000);
}
```

Output:
```
Using var: 5
Using var: 5
Using var: 5
Using var: 5
Using var: 5
```

In this case, all the `console.log` statements log `5`, as `var` has function-level scope, and all the callbacks share the same `i`.

**Example 2: Using `let` in a loop with asynchronous code:**

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    setTimeout(function() {
        console.log("Using let: " + i);
    }, 1000);
}
```

Output:
```
Using let: 0
Using let: 1
Using let: 2
Using let: 3
Using let: 4
```

With `let`, each callback captures the block-scoped value of `i`, resulting in the expected behavior.

**Example 3: Using `var` in a loop without asynchronous code:**

```javascript
for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    console.log("Using var: " + i);
}
```

Output:
```
Using var: 0
Using var: 1
Using var: 2
Using var: 3
Using var: 4
```

In this case, using `var` in a synchronous context works as expected since there are no asynchronous callbacks involved.

**Example 4: Using `let` in a loop without asynchronous code:**

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    console.log("Using let: " + i);
}
```

Output:
```
Using let: 0
Using let: 1
Using let: 2
Using let: 3
Using let: 4
```

With `let`, the behavior is consistent both in asynchronous and synchronous contexts. Each iteration captures its own block-scoped value of `i`.

In general, it's recommended to use `let` for block-scoped variables, especially in modern JavaScript, to avoid unintended side effects and issues related to variable scoping.


When you use the `const` keyword in JavaScript, you declare a variable that cannot be reassigned after its initial value is set. This provides a way to create immutable variables, which can be helpful for maintaining a more predictable and error-free code. Here are a few examples of how `const` can be used:

**Example 1: Declaring a Constant Value:**

```javascript
const pi = 3.14159;
console.log(pi); // Output: 3.14159

// Attempting to reassign a constant will result in an error:
// pi = 3.14; // Error: Assignment to a constant variable
```

In this example, we declare a constant variable `pi` and set its initial value to a mathematical constant. Trying to reassign `pi` will result in an error.

**Example 2: Using `const` with Objects:**

```javascript
const person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30
};
console.log(person.name); // Output: "John"

// You can modify properties of a constant object:
person.age = 31;
console.log(person.age); // Output: 31

// However, you cannot reassign the entire object:
// person = { name: "Alice", age: 25 }; // Error: Assignment to a constant variable
```

In this example, we declare a constant `person` as an object. While you cannot reassign the entire object, you can modify its properties.

**Example 3: Using `const` in Loops:**

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
for (const number of numbers) {
  console.log(number);
}
```

In this example, we use `const` to declare the loop variable `number`. The variable is constant within each iteration of the loop. This is often used to prevent unintentional variable modifications within loops.

**Example 4: Constants in Functions:**

```javascript
function calculateArea(radius) {
  const pi = 3.14159;
  return pi * radius * radius;
}

console.log(calculateArea(5)); // Output: 78.53975
```

In this example, we declare a constant `pi` within a function to calculate the area of a circle. The constant `pi` is used within the function and cannot be reassigned.

Using `const` helps make your code more robust and self-documenting by indicating that a variable should not be changed after its initial assignment. However, keep in mind that while the variable itself is constant, it doesn't make the referenced data (e.g., properties of an object) immutable, as demonstrated in the second example. To achieve immutability for complex data structures, you would need to use techniques like deep freezing or libraries designed for immutable data.
